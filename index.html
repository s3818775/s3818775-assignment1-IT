        <h3>Personal information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I am Truong Thanh Long, my student number is s3818775, email is longthanhtruongz@gmail.com.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>Hello everyone, I come from Ho Chi Minh city. I am basically Kinh culture, because my mom is a Saigonese but she learned about biotechnology and she has to move to Vinh Long for the business purpose . But I am still staying and learning in Ho Chi Minh city. I learned some code when I was in grade 12 about basic python and C++, but the sad thing is my high school did not focus much on IT and I can not study anything advanced about it. I have a dream that I can work while travelling around the world. I love to look at the world through my experience and community activities.
            </li>
            <br>
            </ul>

        <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The first laptop was fixed by hand when I was in grade 9. I was trying to fix the 5 year old dell laptop which my mom gave to me. At that time, I just wanted to fix it and use it to play League of legend. Until now, I clearly still remember problems of the laptop is dead cpu, battery and open electrical circuit for gpu. For fixing the gpu, i took out the cpu, ram, battery, and made it open then put it into the sheet and waited for 30 minute for making the laptop too hot that can help the circuit of the gpu auto welder together. Next, I bought the core 2 duo for laptop at the shop specialized to sell old oem accessories. Finally, it worked very well but after 5 months the laptop died. My mom bought for me new PC accessories and again, I tried to build the PC on my own. And then I have loved IT since the summer 2014 by my mom and the game I was playing.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>RMIT is the most famous school in Viet Nam with many majors. Actually, RMIT teaches me in practical learning which is my best way to learn and most schools in Viet Nam just teach theoretical learning. That is why RMIT is my best choice when I stay learning in Viet Nam. In addition, RMIT has a friendly environment that I had heard from my sister ( an old RMIT student). I only have 2 reasons for studying at RMIT.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>I hope to obtain code skills to make my code better than it is now. I love to be an application programmer and that is why I chose to learn code lots. Because I am a type of person who loves everything, but now I just want to learn everything in IT fields. I expect that when I graduate I will have the best job to learn something new from the job. Not a high salary is OK but high education.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ideal job</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When I graduate I hope to do full stack development in the FPT, because I want to learn more in this job which includes many skills in IT that I want to do. Like I said above that I love to learn everything in IT fields.</li>
            <br>
          <li>Now, I do not have many skills for the job requirement but I will try my best to obtain more in IT to be a full stack developer.</li>
            <br>
          <li>I will try to obtain my IT major with many sources on the internet and school. Thanks to the technologies that I easily find many sources to learn about technologies. I had heard that Intelligence accounts for only 10% and 90% of hard work to be successful.</li>
            <br>
          <li>Full stack development requires me to understand many skills in the IT field such as sever (SQL), hardware, html, python, so on.</li>

        <h3>Project ideas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Overview</li>
        
        <p>“Your Home Doctor” is the application for medical care at home. Nowadays, social science has developed astonishingly, but with that development, people are more susceptible to illness due to the environment and life being turned upside down due to having to make money. This application will use artificial intelligence that looks at the illness information or a x-ray picture of the patient to diagnose what illnesses they get. Moreover, the application will show the best doctor for every single illness that people can schedule for the hospital where the doctor works to have the most accurate appointment. I hope it can take less time for illnessers (patients).</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Description</li>
        <p>Easy to register:<br>
            Most people in the rural area just only have phone numbers or email, that is why the application just registers by phone numbers, email, or facebook, google so on (for choice). Moreover, sometimes the travellers stay in another country that they do not know how to call the hospital for emergency things that they want easy to access the application.
            </p>
        
        <p>Minimalism interface:<br>
            Minimal design is the best way to design an application interface for medical which includes many advantages for the users. First, it is designed for every person and every class, the way applications are made for people who do not have acknowledgement in technologies can easily access.
            </p>
        
        <p>Finding exactly doctor:<br>
Using this the patient’s information that the application can find accurately the specialized doctor of the patient’s illness. Next, the patient can schedule with the hospital to meet the doctor on the day that doctor has time.
            </p>
        
        <p>Notification tool:<br>
After taking the patient's information, the application can easily notify them of time to use medicine. For example, a person who has a stroke when they have met someone but do not remember to use medicine and it will happen to them, the person they meet can see their phone to take the medicine for them easily by using a picture and name of the medicine to get someone to know how to take it.
            </p>
        <p>Reporting about the illness:<br>
Day by day it records the illness of the patient and uses artificial intelligence to evaluate how the illness will be next which can help the patient understand their health status more clearly.
            </p>
        
        <p>Connecting with the smartwatch:<br>
Nowadays, people tend to use smartwatches a lot which include many health features such as measuring heartbeat, ECG measurement, and so on. It is a very important statistics for the application that it can track the patient and healthy people everyday.
</p>

        <p>Connecting with new medical equipment:<br>
In the future, I believe the development of medical technologies will create many medical devices for individual users. It is very important if the application can connect with this all device to evaluate the health of the client. 
</p>
        <p>Using navigation call the ambulance and show the near hospital:<br>
It is the most important part for travelers which help them know the hospital near them in the emergency problem. In addition, the function call ambulance is very important because it has to have many functions such as easy to get in the call, directly connect with the phone to if the smartphone does not have internet it can use anytime. This application uses data from the phone to load some basic things with no internet connection.
</p>

        <p>Many feature will update soon:<br>
It will have many medical features in the future because some technologies are not available at this time and I will connect with medical device development companies to add more features for the application in the future. It will be the best medical application for everyone from childrens to parents.
</p>

            <li>Tool and technology</li>
        <p>As I look at the internet with my little experience. I will use python R for artificial intelligence which is the best tool for machine learning. Next, I use javascript to make the online application for every device can connect with. For Apple devices, specifically iOS and macOS, I use Xcode to write the application for iOS and macOS. Moreover, on the android platform I try to use C++ to write the application for android devices. And they have many tools to write this application but I will research and learn more about it. The most important is that every information of users will be encrypted for security reasons.
        </p>

            <li>Skill required</li>
        <p>This is a complex application that uses a lot of languages in IT fields. For example, with Apple it requires me to use codeX, for android it needs me to do with C++, machine learning uses python R, and python will use it to encrypted the client’s information, and many language to have a best medical application about data, sever, it alots. More than using it in the IT field is I have to learn design, understand people, I will research more because I can think a lot of that.
        </p>

            <li>Outcome</li>
        <p>I try to connect with the WHO and many medical international groups to make it available around the world. It makes for medical reasons that I do not try to make more profit for this project. I will try to call for capital from many big companies and charity funds that I will have an expense for this project. I love to help the world rather than making profit for my application. ( if I want to make profit I will use the hospital who pays for me. Moreover, the application will be an advertisement for the doctors around the world. In addition, using artificial intelligence to take their information for selling medicine is the best way for making money in this application. But I will not try to make profit for that application.).
